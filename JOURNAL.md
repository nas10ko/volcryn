# June 6th: Initial Constraints and Brainstorming

**Design breif:** design a robot that would be legal to compete in the "antweight" category in battlebots, meaning it would have to weigh less than 1 pound. Accoring to my personal design goals, the robot design should be prioritized on making it as small as possible while also being competative. 

**Design Constraints:**
1. Must be under 500g (1 lbs) in total weight
2. Should be as small as possible to be harder to hit
3. Should be able to move around at a minimum of 60 in/sec

From my research, antweight robots fall under 2 main categories: those with vertical spinners and those with horizontal spinners. These are the main weapons that are used, and both have their own unique advantages and disadvantages.

	Vertical Spinners: uneven bar that spins on the axis parallel to the ground
 
	Pros | Flings opponents up so they can flip over, 
 		takes up limited space, 
    		works well with wedges, 
       		easier to right itself
	 
 	Cons | smaller radius = less inertia = less force, 
  		harder to manufacture/replace if it breaks

  	Horizontal Spinners: even or uneven bar that rotates on the axis perpendicular to the ground
   
	Pros | Flings opponents up to the sides (also could flip), 
 		hits with more power due to higher interia, 
   		harder to hit the robot because of it
     
 	Cons | mounted on an exposed part of the robot, 
  			takes up more space, 
     			doesn't flip over robots as often

Accoring to the differnt pros and cons, I will be going with the vertical spinner design to keep in the theme of making this robot small but also powerful, so the smaller profile of the vertical spinner will help maintain that smaller form factor. From what I saw, the drives just need to be powerful enough to move the robot around, but aren't used a lot for pushing, so 2 motors (one per side) should be fine. To better distribute the robot footprint, I will be using 4 smaller wheels with belts to connect them together so the sides of the drivetrain move together from that one motor. 

**Additional things I noticed from watching videos:**
- wedges are really helpful to lead the opponent robots into the weapon
- having a "lip" or spikes to hold the opponent robot makes it harder for them to escape, but not really needed
- belts for getting power from motors are great, but shoukd be well protected, especially the wheels
- the battery should be well protected but also be easily accessible for charging
- weight should not be cut too much on the weapon because it needs to be powerful and its already small ish
- robots that were hit from wedged areas went around the arena less than those that got hit from flat sides
- materials that had very little bend but not dense broke a lot (likes of petg), and flexible mayerials (like boiled nylon) withstood forces better
- matches don't last very long, so a big battery isn't needed, as it can be charged or swapped every round

**Total time spent: 2h**
mainly researching, analizing matches, and picking the mechanism to focus on
